# Intro

That is an experiment about how to ease documenting stuff in tripleo-ci team. 

That website can be edited at by team members at [http://app.gitbook.com](http://app.gitbook.com) which also permits reviews and merges. 

* The result is a pure markdown documentation saved in github.
* it can also be written directly in [https://github.com/ssbarnea/3oci-docs](https://github.com/ssbarnea/3oci-docs) 
* editors can leave in-line comments 
* it can be hosted under any domain, as long we can add a CNAME
* we can decide to move to another platform at any time as the content is stored in git, as standard Markdown file. 
* each page URL is customizable, making much easier to share links to the right document \(intead of cryptic ones like google docs\) 
* very good code formatter and also ability to upload images. changes are not imediatelly saved, so you have the option to review them before publishing them. 

Give it a try and lets see if it suit our needs.
