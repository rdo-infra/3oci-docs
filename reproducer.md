## Getting Super Powers Becoming 

a super hero is a fairly straight forward process: 

`$ give me super-powers`

 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours. Once you're strong enough, save the world: 

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="foo.sh" %}
```bash
# that is a comment
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}
